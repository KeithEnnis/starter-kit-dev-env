# starter-kit-dev-env
My attempt at JS dev environment started kit

Editor config so with the plugin for VS code I can be consistant with my team on code formatting.
Package.json so the project can npm install some essentials
Also the  Scripts section has some auto set up since you can run it all with npm start from the root folder
it will use an npm security package to check the npm modules for dodgy vulnerabilities followed by booting a node server (srcServer.js)
